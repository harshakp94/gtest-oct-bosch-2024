monitorNoMessageForLowSpeed,Confirm that pushMessage is not called when currentSpeed is below _speedThreshold, Set _speedThreshold to a value greater than the currentSpeed returned by BNFSpeedSensor,pushMessage is not called
monitorSendMessageForHighSpeed,Verify that a message is sent to pushMessage when currentSpeed exceeds _speedThreshold,Set _speedThreshold to a value lower than currentSpeed,"pushMessage is called with a message formatted as: ""Current Speed in Miles(converted speed from KMPH to MPH))"""
monitorErrorHandlingForPushMessage,Ensure that an error message is printed when pushMessage returns a status code indicating failure (400+),Mock pushMessage to return a status code of 401 or above.,"Communitcation Error Message ""Error In Communication Unable to Contact Server""."
